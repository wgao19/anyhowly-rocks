Today is one of those days where you do anything anything kenot. Normally those days would go well for climbing. But today climbing also kenot 🤷🏻‍♀️.

Anyway, me and two friends decided to go for BoulderActive team event this year. Cuz we feel like to <3 And here we are the world's most difficult problem -- naming our team.

Here's what we've gone through

- team wu ming
- team don't crimp that
- team don't crimp that 🙄🙄🙄 <- by the guy who crimps that
- team Drop Knees Not Bombs?
- team jugs please
- team why so hard
- team what are those?
- team ho wan
- team mo thy
- team can WAN
- team mid (timid)
- team ber lands

Apparently my friends got 🦄 in their heads.

Eventually, we decided to go with team can WAN. Precisely, it's not team can WAN, it's team can waaaaaaaaaa~~~~~n. It's a Singaporean thing and rest of the night goes to me trying to get that can waaaaaaaaaaaan right. I think they tried to fill my head with some tens ways of saying can, can? can lor, kenot, can meh, can waaaaaaaaaan liddat but I dun think I remember anything except for can waaaaaaaaaan.

- Can?
- Can waaaaaaaaaaaan

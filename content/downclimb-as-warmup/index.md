I've been slacking with climbing recently. I shall state no excuse whatsoever but during my slackish climbs I found one warmup routine that I really like which is: downclimbing.

Warming up is not fun. You should not do the hard problems cuz your body isn't that ready. Most of the text I read suggest warming up on problems at least 2 V-grades lower than your project or even more. Here's one of my favorite: First, do as low V-grade as possible until they sum up to your project grade. The example it gives says if you are working on V9, 9 OK? You should first do V1s and V2s, maybe 3 V2's and 3 V1's and if I did my math correctly, they add up to V9. Then you should do 3 V3's. Then, one V4 and one V5.

I'm an amateurish climber. My hardest project has been among V5-ish, most are lower. I get the idea although I'd run out of low-V's pretty quickly. And based on my experience, my performance peak would not come until I've done many more easy to medium problems.

## A three-step guide on how to boot start your trip in a climbing gym ðŸ˜‚

### Step 1: You know there is such a gym

I have been watching Niklasâ€™ YouTube channel, this guy with a hot German accent is nothing short of awesomeness. After knowing my itinerary would be passing by Sydney, I felt lucky that a bored afternoon triggered me to search for where it is â€” literally 7 min drive from the airport.

### Step 2: Even if you donâ€™t think it would happen, you get yourself a visa anyway.

Just in case your flight is delayed, you find yourself some better activity than eating.

### Step 3: Your airline cancelled your flight

Hereâ€™s how it all magically came together ðŸ¤ª.. Yesterday afternoon I received an email saying that part of my flight was cancelled ðŸ˜± And my airline never contacted me. After a few failed call I decided to book another flight on my own (thank citibank to have covered that). It turns out that this gave me a nice empty evening in the city of Sydney. Guess where I would go?
